# Software Architecure and Design Project

In this project, we extract the CK Metrics related to a java project by using a online tool [CK-Metrics tool](https://github.com/mauricioaniche/ck), and process them using Python.

In order to integrate the tool to run in python, we have created a JAR file for the tool(ck.jar), which we can run from the directory where the jar is located using the follwing command in CMD:

'''
java -jar ck.jar
'''

After running the Jar file, we can run the python file(Main.py) located in the same directory as the jar file using the follwoing command:
```python
s = "Python Main.py"
print s
```
